var tab1text ='<b>About</b><br\>Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency essentially means that you have a, well, deficiency of Alpha-1 Antitrypsin. This can happen for a couple reasons, which I\’ll cover in the genetics section. Now, you may be wondering a few things - things that will hopefully be answered right now, in the following sections.\<br></br\><b>What is Alpha-1 Antitrypsin?</b> <br\>Ok, so there’s this thing called Neutrophil: It’s naturally in your body, and it’s used to fight off infections in your lungs by basically destroying the infected tissue - that’s a good thing. What’s not a good thing is that Neutrophil also destroys healthy lung tissue. Luckily for us, however, we have something to neutralize the Neutrophil so it doesn’t damage our tissue: Alpha-1 Antitrypsin(AAT). AAT is a compound that forms in your liver then moves through your bloodstream until it reaches your lungs, after which it neutralizes the neutrophil and prevents excess damage.'
